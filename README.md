# SecureVoting
Submission for code.fun.do++ 2019.

EVM was introduced to make voting process fast and secure. But now, number of candidates has increased and hence EVM is no more secure and fast enough. EVM is theoritically hackable and counting of votes is still manual which takes too much time. Also there are many fraud voters who votes in place of others.
Block chain can be used to build to voting system which is more efficient.
<b>Because India is still a developing nation, not everyone can use smartphones or computers for voting. So, the voters will vote by going to the booths but instead of EVM, we will use Blockchain system.</b>
